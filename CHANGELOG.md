## Electron Version (v3.x)

### [3.3.0] - 2026-10-01

A laptop at 3840x768, the wall's own 5:1, now fills the whole wall.

#### Added

- **The capture card's black bars are cropped away.** The wall's Elgato cards
  always deliver 3840x2160, whatever the source sends, and fit any other shape
  inside with pure black around it. A laptop at 3840x768 therefore arrived as a
  band a third of the frame tall, and single view showed it small in the middle
  of the wall with black all round. The bars are found in the thumbnail the
  health check already takes, snapped to a known shape (5:1, 16:10, 21:9...) and
  cropped with `object-view-box`, so the picture is fitted as it really is. A
  shape only takes effect after three identical readings. `cropLetterbox: false`
  in `settings.json` turns it off
- **A tip to fill the wall.** In single view, when a laptop sends something
  narrower than 16:9 (1920x1200, say), a 15-second tip suggests setting it to
  3840 x 768. The Apple TV is native 16:9 and never triggers it

#### Fixed

- **Freeze stretched the picture.** The frozen frame was drawn over the whole
  area regardless of shape, so a 16:9 picture became almost three times too wide
  on the 5:1 wall. It is now fitted, and cropped, exactly as the live feed is
- The health log printed `±` as two garbage characters in Windows tools; it now
  prints `+/-`

#### Known issue

- The crop is re-measured from the picture, so pure-black, symmetric content (a
  black slide, a screensaver) can make it resize. Saved per-input boxes that only
  change on a real resolution change are tracked in #316

### [3.2.1] - 2026-10-01

A capture card that opens but delivers nothing is now noticed and reopened, and
the app keeps a record of what it saw.

#### Fixed

- **A card that came up dark stayed dark until someone restarted the app.** The
  wall would boot with a capture input showing black while its source was live.
  The stream had opened, so nothing downstream knew it was bad, and nothing ever
  retried. Each input is now checked every 2 s: a failed open, a track that ends,
  a card that delivers no frames, frames that stop after flowing, and a picture
  that stays one flat colour are all reopened with a backoff
  - It counts frames rather than measuring motion, so a held slide, which still
    arrives at 60 fps, is healthy (#159)
  - A reopen releases every side showing that card before opening it again.
    Chromium shares one capture session per device, so reopening one panel while
    the other still held a track never actually closed the card
  - If no capture devices were found at startup, they are now looked for again
    rather than never

#### Added

- **A persistent log**, `<userData>/logs/input-viewer-YYYY-MM-DD.log`: everything
  both processes print, plus renderer and GPU process crashes and how long the OS
  had been up at launch. Seven days are kept, with a 20 MB/day cap and a per-minute
  line limit, so a log loop cannot fill the disk. Before this nothing survived the
  app, so a bad morning left no trace of what the renderer had seen
- Each input's health is logged when it changes, with a baseline line every 10
  minutes: frame rate, picture brightness, the resolution the card agreed to, and
  how many reopens it took. `__health()` in DevTools prints the same

### [3.2.0] - 2026-08-26

The Art-Net lighting now follows *where* things are on the wall, not just their
average colour.

#### Added

- **Spatial mode** (`artnetTarget: "spatial"`, or per screensaver). Maps the
  wall's colours onto the fixtures nearest them: a green column on the left of
  the picture lights the left of the room. The videowall runs along one edge, so
  a strip at room-x 4 m sits under the part of the picture at the same horizontal
  position. Each strip's own pixels are interpolated along its length via
  `POST /strips/{name}/pixels`, so a one-metre horizontal strip carries a real
  gradient — and costs the same single request a flat colour would

  Two constraints shape it. There is **no bulk write**, so each update sends only
  the strips whose colour moved perceptibly, most-changed first, capped at eight:
  a screensaver with its action in one corner spends the whole budget there, and
  a near-static one stops sending. And the mapping is normalised against **the
  strips' own extent**, read from `GET /layout` — this rig spans x 1.5–10.5 m of
  a 12 m room, so using the room width would map the outer eighth of the picture
  at each side onto bare floor

  Columns are averaged luminance-weighted rather than flat. Most screensavers are
  mostly black, and a flat mean pulls every column toward black and leaves the
  room a uniform dim wash — the failure the feature exists to avoid

- **Default screensaver pairings**: Plasma drives the relay's `plasma` field,
  Metaballs drives `blobs`, Wave Tank drives `ripple`. Only pairings where the
  effect genuinely mirrors the screen; a mismatched effect puts the room out of
  step with the wall, which is worse than the dominant colour. Choose *Reactive*
  to opt out

#### Fixed

- **Every effect was sent the spot's parameters.** Each effect on the relay
  declares its own set and the relay ignores anything else — silently, with a
  200. `effect:plasma`, which takes `scale`/`speed`/`brightness` and no colour at
  all, received seven keys it had no use for and ran at its defaults forever. It
  looked wired up and was not, and nothing anywhere failed. Each of the seven
  field effects now gets the parameters it actually accepts, driven from the
  frame; the ten the relay cannot nudge are started once and left alone rather
  than re-poked every second
- Choosing **Reactive** for a paired screensaver did nothing. The settings list
  stores Reactive by deleting the entry, which for a paired saver fell straight
  back through to the pairing — and the dropdown read `Reactive` while the effect
  was running, stating the opposite of what the room was doing
- A failed spatial write was recorded as the strip's current colour, which would
  have left that strip stuck on whatever it was showing, permanently skipped as
  unchanged while every other strip tracked the wall

### [3.1.0] - 2026-08-25

Art-Net grows up: the lighting is configurable from the UI, can differ per
screensaver, and puts the room back when the screensaver ends.

#### Added

- **Art-Net settings in the UI** — Settings now has an Art-Net Lighting section
  with the relay URL, target, max brightness, spot depth and release scene. These
  were file-only, which meant editing `settings.json` with the app closed, since
  it rewrites that file whenever any setting changes
- **Per-screensaver lighting** (`artnetSceneBySaver`, or the Per Screensaver list
  in settings). Each screensaver can drive the lights from its own picture (the
  default), hold a fixed scene, run an effect, or leave the room alone. Rows are
  rendered from the registry, so a new screensaver appears automatically
- **The room is restored when the screensaver ends.** On activation the app reads
  `GET /status` and remembers the per-strip colours plus any effect already
  running; when the signal comes back it writes that state back. Plugging a
  laptop in returns the lighting to however it actually was — including *off* —
  rather than to a configured guess. This is the first and only read this app
  makes of the relay; everything else it does there writes

  Rotation between screensavers deliberately does **not** re-read that state. By
  then the fixtures are showing the app's own lighting, so a second read would
  destroy the only record of what was there before.

  Where the read fails there is nothing to restore to, and it falls back to
  `artnetReleaseScene` if set and otherwise sends nothing at all. Never a
  blackout: a room that may have people in it does not go dark because a video
  signal came back.

#### Fixed

- **`artnetSpotDepth` could not persist.** `saveSettings()` builds an explicit
  allowlist and a key missing from it is silently reset to its default on the
  next load. The setting shipped in 3.0.0 without being added to that list, so it
  loaded, worked, and was reverted to `0.5` by the next unrelated save — changing
  the volume was enough. The allowlist test now derives its expected keys from
  the main process's defaults, so adding a setting without wiring it in fails
- Rotation stopped a running effect based on the previous screensaver's *mode*,
  but a reactive screensaver inherits the global `artnetTarget` — which may
  itself be an effect. An effect could therefore be running while the mode read
  `reactive`, skipping the stop in exactly the case the guard existed for, and
  leaving the room animating underneath the next screensaver's scene
- A configured release scene returned early without stopping a running effect,
  so the effect kept overwriting the scene it was meant to hand over to

### [3.0.0] - 2026-08-25

The screensaver set numbers 29, and the videowall renders them **43× faster** than
it did at the start of the 2.x line.

This release consolidates the 2.14.0–2.19.0 tags, which shipped incrementally but
were never written up here. No API or settings key was removed: 3.0.0 marks a
milestone rather than a break, so an existing `settings.json` carries over
untouched.

#### Performance

The wall was running the split-flap boards and several screensavers at a few
frames per second. Three causes, all found by measurement after three plausible
hypotheses turned out to be wrong:

- **A per-frame GPU readback cost 40×.** Art-Net's frame sampling ran even with
  Art-Net disabled. Gating it on the setting and rate-limiting the readback to 1Hz
  took the wall from **1.4 fps to 45.3**
- **A system-volume poll cost the rest.** It shelled out to PowerShell every two
  seconds, compiling C# via `Add-Type` each time. Scoping it to when the dropdown
  is actually open took **45.3 fps to 59.7** — the vsync ceiling
- **The split-flap boards kept animating underneath the screensaver** that
  covered them, and now stop

Frame time is now 0.25ms of work in a 16.74ms frame: the loop is idle 98.5% of it,
waiting on vsync. Two savers were also fixed on their own terms — Raymarch Fractal
**18.4 → 31.7 fps** and Flow Field **15.6 → 33.3 fps** at 6000×1200.

Ruled out along the way, and worth recording so nobody re-investigates them:
software rendering, the detection downscale (0.49ms, constant in source
resolution), `resize()` forcing layout, and the capture service.


#### Added

- Four new screensavers: **Physarum** (slime-mould transport network), **Aquarium**
  (schooling fish), **Bicycle Horizon** (first-person cycling POV), and **Weather**,
  which renders the live conditions for a configured location
- **Falling Sand**, **Frost** and **Tree Growth** screensavers
- **Art-Net reactive mode** — pushes the active screensaver's dominant colour to the
  `artnet-relay` service so the room lighting matches the wall. Off by default
- Reference manager in settings, surfacing orphaned no-signal references
- `npm run bench` — benchmarks the CSS, WebGPU and OffscreenCanvas-worker
  compositing paths on a real GPU

Weather and Art-Net are both **off by default** and make no network requests until
configured. See the README for what each sends and where.

#### Changed

- **Eleven screensavers rewritten for the videowall.** Each was redesigned for
  6000×1200 seen across a lit room, rather than tuned:
  - **Plasma** — detail moved out of chroma and into luminance, then lit as a
    heightfield from the analytic fBm gradient. Replaces a wall of undifferentiated
    purple with no large-scale variation
  - **Raymarch Fractal** — penumbra-tracking soft shadows, ambient occlusion, a real
    environment used as both background and IBL source, orbit-trap colouring, and
    temporal accumulation that removes the crawling silhouette
  - **Julia Family** — Julia Set and Mandelbrot are now one saver: a continuous
    dive through the Mandelbrot set with the corresponding Julia set following it
    across the frame, so the wall shows the relationship between the two rather
    than each in isolation. The earlier unbounded-dive work by perturbation
    theory lives on inside it
  - **Reaction Diffusion** — lit as a relief rather than colour-mapped. Base hue now
    comes from a curated set, so the palette can no longer land on gold or amber
  - **Voronoi** — lit facets, cell count scaled to canvas area, and a bounded value
    range feeding the palette
  - **Metaballs** — a lit, refracting fluid on a Newton-solved 3D isosurface with
    Beer–Lambert interior depth. Replaces concentric rainbow rings on a brown field
  - **Matrix Rain** — real glyphs from the shared atlas across three parallax planes
    on true black. Replaces independently-hashed dot matrices, which were noise
    rather than characters
  - **Starfield Warp** — hundreds of instanced stars with blackbody colour and a
    clear vanishing point, replacing roughly thirty white dashes on flat navy
  - **Pong** — the court letterboxed into a CRT cabinet with a real phosphor
    accumulation buffer. Previously the paddles sat 5460px apart with an empty middle
  - **Truchet Tiles** — multi-scale woven bundles with continuous per-path colour and
    a retiling front that sweeps the wall. Tiles retile by rotating a quarter turn,
    untying and retying as they go
  - **Moiré Interference** — fringes computed analytically from the difference term of
    the grating product, rather than left to emerge from sampling. The look no longer
    depends on pixel pitch, so it is identical on a laptop and on the wall
- **The Dual/Single layout transition and input switch are animated**, and the
  screensaver rotation now fades between savers instead of cutting
- `shadercheck` structure baselines updated for six of those savers. Five moved
  **down** and one **up**: the check counts spatial high-frequency content rather than
  structure, so the old values were partly inflated by the very noise these rewrites
  removed. Plasma now sits below the absolute margin and has lost effective coverage;
  Truchet had been carrying a baseline four times below its real density, so a large
  regression there would have passed silently. See #192

#### Fixed

- `createGLRuntime()` did not size the canvas, while 15 screensavers derived an
  aspect, particle count or simulation grid from its dimensions immediately after
  construction. On a first run that meant reading the 300×150 HTML default — on the
  6000×1200 wall, an aspect of 2.0 instead of 5.0
- Oriented quads in Boids were sheared by the display aspect, because the per-axis
  pixel-to-clip conversion was applied before the rotation rather than after
- `shadercheck`'s structure check failed nondeterministically. The measurement was
  taken at a single frame and is bimodal for small-sprite savers; it now samples a
  window and requires any drop to be absolutely meaningful as well as relatively large
- A `node_modules` symlink was committed and both `.gitignore` files only matched the
  directory form, so the symlink slipped past
- The release workflow staged only `VERSION` and `package.json`, silently discarding
  the `package-lock.json` half of every version bump
- The DVD logo was sized from the long axis, so it filled the 5:1 wall; it now
  comes off the short axis
- The `D` and `S` layout shortcuts were never wired up, and audio was paired by
  device id rather than `groupId`
- The dual-view dropdown columns overflowed the panel
- No-signal references are stored at detection resolution rather than full frame
